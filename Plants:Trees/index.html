              Trees are remarkable organisms on our planet. Estimated to have
              first came to existence around 400 million years ago, trees have
              changed in various ways.

              "400 million years ago: Fossil records of the first tree-like
              plants appear, such as lycophytes, ferns, and horsetails. These
              types of plants did not have seeds yet, but were the first to have
              vascular systems, which was a big deal because that gave plants
              the ability to raise off the ground and form trunks and branches.
              Before this, all of earth’s plants had to live close to the
              ground, like mosses and liverworts." -a brief history of

              Some trees grow close to the ground, for example dwarf willow
              (Salix herbacea) which reaches a mere 1-6 CM in height. Some trees
              grow tall like skyscrapers like Hyperion; a coast redwood (Sequoia
              sempervirens).

          Plants typically have softer stems and tissue, whereas trees tend to
          have a more woody and hard trunk and branches. Plants usually do not
          reach more than 10 feet in height and can also have a ground covering
          aspect you do not see with trees. Some explamples would be
          grasses,mosses,shrubs,mats and clumps. Plants have generally been
          around as long as trees have, and their features are still reconized
          in land plants we see today.

          "Many plants have vascular tissue, such as xylem and phloem, that
          carries water and nutrients throughout the plant. This is particularly
          important for plants that grow upwards; water needs to travel from the
          roots up the stem to the leaves. Vascular tissue is found in more
          “complex” plants. Plants are believed to have evolved from algae-like
          ancestors. Today, most modern-day algae are classified as bacteria,
          not plants. However, green algae, which also have cellulose in their
          cell walls and have chloroplasts that perform photosynthesis, are
          sometimes grouped with plants." - Plant (2017),biology
